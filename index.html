            <h2>PERSONAL SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>My name is Engr. Kufreabasi Ita. I am a COREN registered engineer with over 5 years of experience as a Design and Project Engineer. I have participated in and managed teams formed to design, test and survey several Civil and Marine Engineering related projects. I am adept at creating aesthetically appealing and structurally sound engineering designs. I am currently seeking to build a career in Software Engineering because I am interested in machine learning and software development. I believe that, deploying my proficiencies and skill as a designer and product developer and leveraging on my innate motivation to create sustainable solutions, I am well suited to succeeding in this field.</p>
