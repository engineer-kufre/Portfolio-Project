                    <p class="para">My name is Engr. Kufreabasi Ita. I am a COREN registered engineer with over 5 years of experience as a Design and Project Engineer. I have participated in and managed teams formed to design, test and survey several Civil and Marine Engineering related projects. I am adept at creating aesthetically appealing and structurally sound engineering designs. I am currently seeking to build a career in Software Engineering because I am interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence and software development. I believe that deploying my proficiencies and skill as a designer and product developer and leveraging on my innate motivation to create sustainable solutions, I am well suited to succeeding in this field.</p>

                    <h2  class="cap">MY DECAGON STORY</h2>
                    <p  class="para">I got wind of this training on a WhatsApp group set up  for volunteer, experienced and entry-level professionals which creates awareness of available opportunities as they arise. I actually only found out about Decagon's SQ004 recruitment after the original assessment date was cancelled. I was a whisker away from missing out but I hurried to register and completed the requisite Free Code Camp html, css and javascript introductory courses in preparation for that weekend's online assessment. Flash back to two months earlier, when a friend of mine shared a flyer advertising a 2-day training in web design. There, I received basic html and css coaching. This was my first real attempt at writing code. I was thus able to focus on the FCC javascript course content and learn as much as I could in the limited time available. I was first introduced to programming as an undergraduate and taught to cram principles in writing V-Basic code. To put it mildly, I hated it. That bad experience left me with the impression that I had no future writing code or developing software. <br><br>
                    For several years I attempted to try my hands on learning to code only to backed off immediately it appeared to get a little confusing. I never did get far beyond "HELLO WORLD". In researching an Engineering Design masters degree programme I was interested in, I found I had developed interest in Robotics. Further digging brought to my knowledge that in order to build a career in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning I needed to learn to write code using Python programming language. This discovery reignited my interest in acquiring coding skills. That 2-day training and my study period with Decagon thus far have made me realise that I possess the aptitude to excel as a Software Engineer. <br><br>
                    The online assessment was a breeze and I was sure I'd passed but after the physical interview at the Ikoyi office, I again began to doubt my powers. I knew the algorithm used to test us was easy because I had only 7 minutes to solve it therefore, the fact that I failed to muster an answer was discouraging. I could explain my attempted solution though, and I believe this was why I was able to scrape my way into the BootCamp. I believe you can already guess that prior to getting into the BootCamp, I hadn't managed to solve any of the Home Study Lab questions and two days into the BootCamp, I still hadn't solved any. I was on the verge of deciding to drop out because I feared that anytime now, I would receive a dreaded email asking me to stay home and never return. I chose to brave it out. I chose to stay. On the third day of BootCamp, I read an article which changed everything for me.</p> <br>

                    I'd recommend that article to any beginner who is experiencing difficulty learning to proffer solutions to algorithms. My knowledge was limited, yes, but my biggest mistake was fear. I failed to understand that problems are essentially solvable and breaking down a seemingly large problem into smaller solution steps meant I could attack even the most complex algorithms. Indeed, I still face some problems which I cannot yet solve but I'll keep chipping away and improving my level of understanding knowing that someday, I will overcome those as well. I scaled the three week probation period by solving katas on <a href="www.codewars.com">Codewars</a> and learning everyday. I am certainly better now than I was. I'm a DECADEV!!!
